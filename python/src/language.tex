\subsection{Loops}
\begin{minted}{python}
while expression:   for element in list:
    commands            commands
else:               else:
    commands            commands
\end{minted}

Note: A \python{break} statement executed in the first suite terminates 
the loop without executing the \python{else} clause's suite.

To terminate immediately the nearest enclosing loop, use \python{break}.
To skip to the next iteration instead, use \python{continue}.

Loopnig on dictionaries and sets loops on keys.
