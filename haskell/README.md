# Haskell

1. **The Haskell Cheatsheet** by Justin Bailey at <http://cheatsheet.codeslower.com/>.
*Learning Haskell is not easy. 
Besides the syntax, concepts, and advanced types, there is a real lack of succinct, accessible references. 
As I learned Haskell I frequently wanted a quick reference for syntax, keywords and other language elements. 
The Haskell Report, while very thorough, wasn't quite it.
For that reason I've created this cheatsheet. 
It's intended for beginning to intermediate Haskell programmers to use 
as a quick-reference guide for syntax, keywords or other language issues.*
